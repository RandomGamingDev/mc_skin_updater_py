# mc_skin_updater_py
A basic file only library for updating Minecraft skins from pre-1.8 to 1.8+ skins in Python using the pillow library

The file only library that you can include is [mc_skin_updater.py](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/mc_skin_updater_py/blob/main/mc_skin_updater.py). To use it simply import the file and then call the convert function with a Pillow image containing your skin (the library will assume that you checked that it's of the old skin type) and then will return the new skin file which you can save or do whatever else you want with it.
If you're still confused you can look at how to use it in [example.py](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/mc_skin_updater_py/blob/main/example.py).

The requirement(s) are in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/mc_skin_updater_py/blob/main/requirements.txt)
